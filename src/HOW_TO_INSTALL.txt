how to install MochaImport+ for Nuke

1) copy this entire folder somewhere on your harddrive
2) make sure the folder is included in your NUKE_PATH environment variable

Instead of adding the folder to your NUKE_PATH, you can also add it to the plugin path in
~/.nuke/init.py

---------------------------------------------------
Example to change init.py on MacOS
Assume you are user JOHN with home directory /Users/JOHN/
and MochaImport+ is located at /Users/JOHN/myTools/mochaImportPlus
Then
1) go to the folder /Users/JOHN/.nuke
2) create the file init.py in this folder if it does not exist yet
3) add the following line to init.py:
nuke.pluginAddPath('/Users/JOHN/myTools/mochaImportPlus');

If you now start nuke, MochaImport+ should be installed.
